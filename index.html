                        <p>
                            Carmen Miranda (February 9, 1909 – August 5, 1955), was a
                            Portuguese-born Brazilian samba singer, dancer, Broadway
                            actress, and film star who was popular from the 1930s to the
                            1950s.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Renowned Actress, Dancer, and Singer. Born in Marco de
                            Canavezes, Portugal, her family moved to Brazil when she was
                            still a toddler. She was singing at her hatmaking job as a
                            teenager when she was discovered by a local promoter. She began
                            singing on local radio and secured a recording contract with
                            RCA, soon becoming a major Brazillian star. Miranda made her
                            United States debut in 1939, singing and dancing in several
                            well-received Broadway revues and nightclub performances.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miranda's rise to stardom in Brazil was linked to the growth of
                            a native style of music: the samba. The samba and Miranda's
                            emerging career enhanced the revival of Brazilian nationalism
                            during the regime of President Getúlio Vargas.[22] Her
                            gracefulness and vitality in her recordings and live
                            performances gave her the nickname "Cantora do It". The singer
                            was later known as "Ditadora Risonha do Samba", and in 1933
                            radio announcer Cesar Ladeira christened her "A Pequena
                            Notável".
